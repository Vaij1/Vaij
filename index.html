            Street Fighter II: The World Warrior[b] is a 2D fighting game developed by Capcom and originally released for arcades in 1991.
            It is the second installment in the Street Fighter series and the sequel to 1987's Street Fighter. 
            It is Capcom's fourteenth game to use the CP System arcade system board. Street Fighter II vastly
            improved many of the concepts introduced in the first game, 
             including the use of special command-based moves, 
              a combo system, a six-button configuration, and a wider selection of playable characters, each with a unique fighting style.
